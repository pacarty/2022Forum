# 2022Forum
This was originally intended as a whirlpool clone (https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/), however ever since the start of development I have written it in my own style, and it doesn't really resemble whirlpool at all. It is more like a generic forum, which is why I have renamed it to 2022Forum.

At the moment the data that I have used to seed the database is taken from the whirlpool forum. This is data that simply used as a placeholder. This forum generates no revenue and is only intended to be used as an education tool and a demonstration of my .NET knowledge.
